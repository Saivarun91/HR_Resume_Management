                    "answer": "Firstly, preprocess the data by cleaning and transforming it to remove noise and handle missing values. Then, I'd select and train a machine learning model, such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or Random Forest, to forecast demand based on historical sales data, promotions, and seasonality. Would tune the model using cross-validation techniques. After evaluation I would deploy the model to make continuous predictions and then integrate it with ERP systems."
