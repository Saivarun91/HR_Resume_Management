Depending on the situation, I might choose to remove rows with missing values, impute them using statistical methods (mean, median, mode), or use more advanced techniques like regression imputation or k-NN imputation. The choice depends on the data and the potential impact on the analysis."

For example, you could use a window function to calculate a running total of sales for each month, partitioned by product category. This allows you to see how each product category is performing over time."

Then, I might consider adding indexes to relevant columns, rewriting the query to use more efficient joins or subqueries, or optimizing the database schema. I would also test the query after each change to ensure that it is actually improving performance."

Then, I would define the attributes for each entity, such as product ID, product name, store ID, store location, etc. Finally, I would define the relationships between the entities, such as one-to-many relationships between stores and products, or many-to-many relationships between products and suppliers.

Then, I would use statistical methods, such as regression analysis or time series analysis, to build a forecasting model. I would also incorporate external factors, such as market trends or seasonality, into the model. Finally, I would continuously monitor and refine the model as more data becomes available."

'A' items are the most valuable and require the most attention, 'B' items are moderately valuable, and 'C' items are the least valuable. In a retail setting, I would implement ABC classification by analyzing sales data to identify the top-selling products (A items), the moderately selling products (B items), and the slow-moving products (C items). Then, I would adjust inventory management strategies accordingly, such as increasing safety stock levels for A items and reducing them for C items."
