'A' items are the most valuable and require the most attention, 'B' items are moderately valuable, and 'C' items are the least valuable. In a retail setting, I would implement ABC classification by analyzing sales data to identify the top-selling products (A items), the moderately selling products (B items), and the slow-moving products (C items). Then, I would adjust inventory management strategies accordingly, such as increasing safety stock levels for A items and reducing them for C items."
