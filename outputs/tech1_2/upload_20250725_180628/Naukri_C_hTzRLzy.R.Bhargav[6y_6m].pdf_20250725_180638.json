Task: I was tasked with developing an inventory strategy to minimize stockouts while optimizing inventory levels. Action: I implemented a demand forecasting model that incorporated historical sales data, seasonality, and promotional activities. I also worked with suppliers to improve lead times and establish safety stock levels. Result: Stockouts were reduced by 40% during the next peak season, and customer satisfaction improved significantly."

Task: I needed to automate the process to improve efficiency and accuracy. Action: I developed a Power BI dashboard that pulled data directly from our ERP system, providing real-time visibility into inventory levels and key metrics. Result: The reporting process was reduced from several days to just a few hours, and the accuracy of the data improved significantly, leading to better decision-making."

Task: I had to develop an allocation strategy that maximized revenue and customer satisfaction. Action: I analyzed sales data, customer demographics, and channel performance to determine the optimal allocation. I allocated a larger portion of the inventory to the online channel, where demand was higher and margins were better. Result: We maximized revenue and customer satisfaction, while also gathering valuable data on channel performance for future decision-making."

I would then investigate the reasons for the slow movement, such as poor product placement, pricing issues, or marketing problems. Based on the findings, I would propose actions such as promotions, markdowns, or discontinuing the item."

The dashboard would include interactive visuals, such as trend charts, heatmaps, and geographical maps, to provide insights into inventory performance across different dimensions. I would also include drill-down capabilities to allow users to explore the data in more detail."

                    "answer": "I would first determine the optimal min and max levels for each item at each location based on demand, lead time, and storage capacity. I would then set up automated replenishment rules in the ERP system to trigger orders when inventory levels fall below the min level. I would also monitor the system regularly and adjust the min and max levels as needed to account for changes in demand or supply."

I would use aggregate functions to calculate key metrics, such as average inventory turnover and total holding costs. I would also use window functions to identify trends and outliers in the data. Based on the findings, I would propose actions such as optimizing inventory levels, improving forecasting accuracy, or reducing holding costs."
