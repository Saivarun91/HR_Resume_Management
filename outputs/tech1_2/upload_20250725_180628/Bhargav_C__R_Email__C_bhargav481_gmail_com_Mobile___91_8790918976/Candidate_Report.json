I would then investigate the reasons for the slow movement, such as poor product placement, pricing issues, or marketing problems. Based on the findings, I would propose actions such as promotions, markdowns, or discontinuing the item."

The dashboard would include interactive visuals, such as trend charts, heatmaps, and geographical maps, to provide insights into inventory performance across different dimensions. I would also include drill-down capabilities to allow users to explore the data in more detail."

                        "answer": "I would first determine the optimal min and max levels for each item at each location based on demand, lead time, and storage capacity. I would then set up automated replenishment rules in the ERP system to trigger orders when inventory levels fall below the min level. I would also monitor the system regularly and adjust the min and max levels as needed to account for changes in demand or supply."

I would use aggregate functions to calculate key metrics, such as average inventory turnover and total holding costs. I would also use window functions to identify trends and outliers in the data. Based on the findings, I would propose actions such as optimizing inventory levels, improving forecasting accuracy, or reducing holding costs."
