    "Recommendations": [
        "**Reduce the resume length** to a maximum of two pages. A concise resume ensures recruiters focus on your most relevant qualifications, as a 4 page resume will automatically deter most recruiters.",
        "While the summary is comprehensive, consider **tailoring it** to specific job descriptions. Highlight the skills and experiences most relevant to the target role to immediately grab the recruiter's attention. For example, you can make different summaries for different jobs",
        "**Add quantifiable achievements** to the experience section. Instead of just listing responsibilities, describe the impact of your work using numbers and metrics to demonstrate your value and create more impact. For example increased efficiency by x%.",
        "**Include details about your role in each project**. Elaborate on your contributions and the technologies you utilized to achieve project goals. This provides a clearer picture of your capabilities. You can describe what the projects were about and the technologies you have added.",
        "Consider adding a **certifications section** if you have any relevant certifications. Certifications demonstrate your commitment to professional development and can significantly enhance your credibility in specific skill areas.",
        "Ensure that the **job titles are clearly defined** to show what position the candidate had in each company. Without clear job titles, the description for each company may be confusing.",
        "Add **more details to the description of each company**. The description for each company does not give a clear description of what that role encompassed. More details can be added."
