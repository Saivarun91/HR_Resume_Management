        "**Enhance Formatting**: Improve the formatting of the resume to make it more visually appealing and easier to read. Ensure there is consistent use of fonts, bullet points, and spacing. A well-formatted resume is easier for both humans and ATS systems to parse.",
        "**Quantify Achievements**: Whenever possible, quantify achievements in the work experience and project sections. Instead of saying you improved report performance, specify by what percentage, e.g., \"Improved report performance by 40% through DAX formula optimization.\"",
        "**Clarify Job Titles**:  The work experience section is missing job titles. Including specific titles for each role held will provide clarity regarding the level of the candidate, adding titles will make the experience section easier to understand.",
        "**Proofread Carefully**: Ensure the resume is free of spelling errors and grammatical mistakes. Even minor errors can detract from the candidate's credibility. Consider using a grammar checking tool.",
        "**Tailor to Job Description**: Customize the resume to match the specific requirements of the job description to which the candidate is applying. Highlight the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the role.",
        "**Add more details to Experience**: The details for the company is missing the type of work you do there and the impact that you provided in your role with KPIs"
