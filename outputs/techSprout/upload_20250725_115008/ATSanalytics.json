        "**Quantify achievements** in the experience section with specific numbers and metrics to demonstrate the impact of your work. For example, instead of saying 'Improved efficiency,' specify 'Improved efficiency by 15% resulting in a cost saving of $50,000'.",
        "Explicitly list **soft skills** relevant to the target roles, such as communication, leadership, problem-solving, and teamwork, to showcase a well-rounded professional profile. Providing clear examples of when these skills were deployed could be powerful.",
        "Add any relevant **certifications** (e.g., CFA, FRM, data analysis certifications) to increase credibility and demonstrate expertise in specialized areas; this will significantly increase your score in certifications",
        "Tailor your resume **objective** more specifically to each job application, highlighting the skills and experiences that align most closely with the requirements of the role. Customize the skills section for each application.",
        "In your **Civil & Project Engineer** role, include the company name. This will provide recruiters with important context.",
        "Re-evaluate the **resume format** to ensure it is ATS-friendly. Using standard fonts and clear section headings can help with parsing.",
        "The resume is two pages, which is acceptable but consider **condensing information** for a one-page resume if possible, focusing on the most relevant achievements. Make sure every piece of information aligns with the job description."
