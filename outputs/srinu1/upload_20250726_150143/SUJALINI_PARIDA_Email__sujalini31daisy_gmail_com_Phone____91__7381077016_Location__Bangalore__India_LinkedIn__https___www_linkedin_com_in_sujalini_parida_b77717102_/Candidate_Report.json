            "While the resume includes certifications, consider quantifying the impact or relevance of these certifications to the target roles. Providing specific examples of how these certifications have contributed to project success can significantly enhance their value. For example, explicitly state how the 'Best Employee Award' has enhanced your skills and what were the parameters that allowed you to achieve such award. Try to align the **certifications** with the role you're seeking to strengthen your application.",
            "Although the resume includes a list of hard skills, it may be beneficial to provide specific examples of how each skill has been applied in previous roles or projects. Instead of just listing 'Power BI,' describe a project where you used Power BI to solve a complex problem or improve decision-making. This will give recruiters a better understanding of your proficiency in each skill and increase your credibility in your domain.",
            "The resume could benefit from the addition of a dedicated 'Projects' section, which would highlight your technical skills and accomplishments. This section allows you to showcase projects that demonstrate your proficiency with key technologies and tools such as Power BI, SQL, and Tableau. Be sure to include details such as the project's objective, your role, the technologies used, and the outcomes achieved.",
            "While the work experience section provides details about your responsibilities and accomplishments, consider quantifying the impact of your work whenever possible. Use metrics and data to illustrate the value you brought to each organization. For example, instead of saying 'Improved reporting accuracy,' say 'Improved reporting accuracy by 15%, leading to a 10% reduction in errors.'",
            "Review each job description for typos and grammatical errors. While overall grammar is good, ensure perfect clarity, especially in sections like responsibilities listed under each work experience.",
            "Expand details of education. Mention GPA or relevant coursework to strengthen academic qualifications.",
            "Consider adding a portfolio link to showcase your projects and accomplishments visually. This is particularly useful for data visualization roles."
