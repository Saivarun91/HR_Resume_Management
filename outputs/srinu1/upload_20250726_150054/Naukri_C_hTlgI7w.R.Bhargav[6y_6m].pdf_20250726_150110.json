I weighed the risks of delaying the deployment versus proceeding with potentially inaccurate data. I decided to proceed with a clear disclaimer and a plan to update the report as soon as the complete data was available. The deployment went ahead, and the report provided valuable insights, albeit with the acknowledged limitations. We updated the report within 24 hours, minimizing the impact of the incomplete data."

Instead of using technical jargon, I used an analogy of a gated community, where each resident (user) can only access their own property (data). This helped them understand the concept of data security and its importance in protecting sensitive sales data."

Task: I took the initiative to debug the DAX formula and identify the root cause of the error. Action: I analyzed the DAX formula, identified the logical error, and corrected it. I then tested the report to ensure that the sales figures were accurate. Result: The corrected report provided accurate sales figures, enabling the sales team to make informed decisions. The improved accuracy led to a 15% increase in sales forecast accuracy."

Task: I needed to restore the report's functionality as quickly as possible. Action: I immediately identified the broken data connection, troubleshooted the issue with the database team, and implemented a temporary workaround while the root cause was being addressed. Result: The report was back online within two hours, minimizing disruption to senior management's decision-making process. We then implemented a permanent fix to prevent recurrence."

Task: I needed to develop a report that would provide actionable insights and meet the client's specific requirements. Action: I worked closely with the client to understand their needs, developed a custom DAX formula to calculate energy consumption metrics, and created interactive visualizations to present the data in a clear and intuitive manner. Result: The client was extremely satisfied with the report, which helped them identify opportunities to optimize energy consumption and reduce costs by 20%."

I would also include a bridge table to handle many-to-many relationships between products and categories. I would optimize the data model for performance by using appropriate data types and creating indexes."

I would then investigate the ETL process to identify any errors or inconsistencies. I would also work with the data owners to ensure that the data is accurate and consistent across all data sources. Finally, I would implement data validation rules to prevent future inconsistencies."
