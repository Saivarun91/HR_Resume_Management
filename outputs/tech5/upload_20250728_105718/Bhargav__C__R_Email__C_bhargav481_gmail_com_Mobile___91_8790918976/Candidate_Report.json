Add specific coursework or projects completed during your B.Sc. in Computer Science that are relevant to your current role or the jobs you are applying for. This provides additional context and showcases your **academic background** effectively.",
            "Quantify achievements in the work experience sections. Instead of just listing responsibilities, provide concrete examples of your impact. For example, mention specific improvements in report generation time or the number of users impacted by your dashboards. Use **metrics and numbers** to showcase your accomplishments.",
            "Tailor the summary to match the specific job description. While the current summary is comprehensive, customizing it to highlight the skills and experiences most relevant to each job application can increase its impact. Emphasize the **keywords and requirements** listed in the job posting.",
            "Proofread the resume thoroughly to eliminate any potential spelling or grammatical errors. Even minor errors can detract from your professionalism. Use **grammar checking tools** and ask someone else to review your resume to catch any mistakes.",
            "Reformat your project descriptions using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to clearly articulate each project's context, your specific role, the actions you took, and the results achieved. This will help demonstrate the **impact and value** of your contributions more effectively."
