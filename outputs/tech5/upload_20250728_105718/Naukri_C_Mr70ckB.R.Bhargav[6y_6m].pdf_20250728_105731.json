Measures are calculated on the fly based on the context of the report and are not stored in the data model. Measures are typically used for aggregations and calculations based on filters and slicers."

                "answer": "Import mode imports data into the Power BI data model, providing fast performance but requiring regular refreshes. DirectQuery mode queries the data source directly, ensuring real-time data but potentially slower performance. Composite mode allows you to combine both Import and DirectQuery modes in a single report, providing flexibility in data access and performance."
