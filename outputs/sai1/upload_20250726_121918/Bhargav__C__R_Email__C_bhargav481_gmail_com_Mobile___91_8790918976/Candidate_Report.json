The formula dynamically adjusts the sales amount based on the selected date range, allowing users to analyze sales trends over time. The formula is complex because it handles multiple date filters and calculates the cumulative sales for each product individually."

                        "answer": "I would first validate the data in the source systems to ensure it is accurate. Then, I would examine the ETL process to identify any data transformation errors or inconsistencies. I would also review the data model relationships and DAX formulas to ensure they are correctly implemented. Finally, I would use Power BI's data profiling tools to identify any data quality issues."
