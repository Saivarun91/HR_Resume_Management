                "answer": "I would first assess the urgency and impact of each request, communicate with stakeholders to manage expectations, and prioritize based on business needs and available resources. If needed, I would negotiate deadlines to ensure all requests are addressed effectively."
            },
            {
                "questions": "Describe a situation where you had to adapt quickly to a significant change in project requirements or data availability.",
                "answer": "In a recent project, a key data source became unavailable unexpectedly. I quickly identified alternative data sources, modified the ETL process, and updated the Power BI reports to ensure minimal disruption. I also communicated the changes to stakeholders and provided revised timelines."

                "questions": "How do you approach decision-making when faced with incomplete or ambiguous data in your analysis?",
                "answer": "I would first try to gather additional data from other sources or stakeholders. If that's not possible, I would make reasonable assumptions based on the available information, document these assumptions clearly, and proceed with the analysis, highlighting the limitations of the data."
            },

                "questions": "Can you describe a time where you had to make a decision that was unpopular with your team, and how did you handle it?",
                "answer": "In a project with conflicting approaches on a feature implementation, I needed to choose the direction that aligned best with the project's timeline, budget and scalability, even though some team members had dissenting opinions. I held a team meeting to thoroughly present the reasoning behind the decision, address concerns, and discuss how to mitigate negative impacts. It's important to approach decisions with transparency and empathy, involving the team and acknowledging their perspectives, to maintain morale and collaboration."

                "answer": "In one project, there were conflicting desires from different stakeholders about the level of detail and the type of metrics to be included in a financial dashboard. To address this, I facilitated a workshop with all stakeholders to prioritize the dashboard's objectives and requirements. I then proposed a solution that involved creating a primary dashboard with key metrics for high-level insights, and additional drill-down dashboards for more detailed analysis, catering to the specific needs of each stakeholder group. This approach ensured that the project met all critical requirements while keeping everyone aligned and satisfied."

                    "answer": "I created a DAX formula to calculate the cumulative sales for each product over time, using the CALCULATE, FILTER, and ALL functions. The formula dynamically adjusts the sales amount based on the selected date range, allowing users to analyze sales trends over time. The formula is complex because it handles multiple date filters and calculates the cumulative sales for each product individually."

                    "questions": "How would you troubleshoot a situation where a Power BI report is showing incorrect data, and you suspect the issue is with the data model or ETL process?",
                    "answer": "I would first validate the data in the source systems to ensure it is accurate. Then, I would examine the ETL process to identify any data transformation errors or inconsistencies. I would also review the data model relationships and DAX formulas to ensure they are correctly implemented. Finally, I would use Power BI's data profiling tools to identify any data quality issues."
