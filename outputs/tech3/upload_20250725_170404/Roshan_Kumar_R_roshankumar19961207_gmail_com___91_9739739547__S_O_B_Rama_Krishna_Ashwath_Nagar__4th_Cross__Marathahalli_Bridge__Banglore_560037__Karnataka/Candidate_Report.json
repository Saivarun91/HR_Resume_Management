        "Recommendations": [
            "While the resume is comprehensive, consider **tailoring the summary or objective** to each specific job application to highlight the most relevant skills and experiences. This can significantly increase the impact of your application and demonstrate a clear understanding of the target role's requirements.",
            "To further enhance the **'Skills'** section, categorize the skills more granularly (e.g., Data Visualization Tools, Database Management Systems) to showcase depth and breadth of expertise. This makes it easier for recruiters and ATS systems to identify specific skills relevant to the job description.",
            "In the **'Experience'** section, quantify your accomplishments whenever possible by including specific metrics and results achieved in each role. For instance, instead of saying 'Improved data analysis processes,' state 'Reduced data analysis time by 20% through process improvements.'",
            "Consider adding a separate **'Awards and Recognition'** section if you have received any notable accolades or achievements during your academic or professional career. This can help you stand out from other candidates and demonstrate a proven track record of excellence.",
            "Ensure that the resume's **formatting** is consistent throughout, including font styles, sizes, and spacing. A visually appealing and well-organized resume can make a positive impression and improve readability for both human reviewers and ATS systems.",
            "While you've listed several **languages**, specifying your proficiency level (e.g., fluent, proficient, basic) for each language can provide a clearer picture of your language skills. This is especially valuable for roles that require multilingual communication abilities.",
            "Think about including a **link to your LinkedIn profile or personal website**, allowing recruiters to quickly access additional information about your background, projects, and accomplishments. Make sure your online profiles are up-to-date and showcase your professional brand."
