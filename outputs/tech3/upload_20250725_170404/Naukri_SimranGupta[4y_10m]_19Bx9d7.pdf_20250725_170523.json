I would then create visualizations such as line charts for historical sales trends, bar charts for current inventory levels by product category, and KPIs for metrics like inventory turnover ratio, stock out percentage, and overstock percentage.I will also add interactive filters for store location, product category, and time period."

                        "answer": "To build a dynamic stocking algorithm, I would start by collecting real-time data on sales, inventory levels, and demand forecasts. Factors to consider include seasonality, promotions, product lifecycle, and competitor activities. The algorithm would use time series analysis to predict demand and adjust stocking levels accordingly, taking into account lead times and safety stock requirements. We'd also need to implement alerts for potential stockouts or overstocks, enabling timely interventions."

                        "answer": "When designing an A/B testing framework for inventory allocation, I would start by defining clear hypotheses, such as whether allocating more stock to online channels during peak seasons would increase overall sales. I would then randomly assign stores to different allocation strategies (e.g., control group vs. test group) and track key metrics such as sales, inventory turnover, stockout rates, and customer satisfaction. Statistical analysis would be used to determine the winning strategy, with continuous monitoring and adjustments as needed."
