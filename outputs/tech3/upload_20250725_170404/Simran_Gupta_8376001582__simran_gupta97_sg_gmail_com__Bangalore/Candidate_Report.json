Factors to consider include seasonality, promotions, product lifecycle, and competitor activities. The algorithm would use time series analysis to predict demand and adjust stocking levels accordingly, taking into account lead times and safety stock requirements.

I would then randomly assign stores to different allocation strategies (e.g., control group vs. test group) and track key metrics such as sales, inventory turnover, stockout rates, and customer satisfaction. Statistical analysis would be used to determine the winning strategy, with continuous monitoring and adjustments as needed."
