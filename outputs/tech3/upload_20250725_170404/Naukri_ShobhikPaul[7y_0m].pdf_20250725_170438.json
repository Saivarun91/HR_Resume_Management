Task: I needed to complete both tasks without compromising quality. Action: I assessed the urgency and impact of each project, communicated the situation to my manager, and negotiated revised deadlines. I then prioritized the data migration due to its long-term impact, and worked extended hours to complete the dashboard on time. Result: Both projects were successfully completed, and stakeholder satisfaction was maintained."

Task: I needed to identify the root cause and implement a solution to improve reliability. Action: I analyzed the ETL pipeline, identified a SQL query causing timeouts, and optimized it by adding indexes and rewriting the logic. Result: The data refresh failures were reduced by 90%, and the dashboard became more reliable for stakeholders."

Task: Improve the model's accuracy and predictive power. Action: I revisited the data, identified feature engineering errors, and incorporated new variables. I also consulted with colleagues to gain insights and adjusted the model architecture. Result: I significantly improved model accuracy after revisiting my initial work."

                            "answer": "I would start by collecting and cleaning the data, then perform feature engineering to create relevant variables. Next, I would split the data into training and testing sets, select appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest), train the model, and evaluate its performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. Finally, I would deploy the model and monitor its performance over time."
