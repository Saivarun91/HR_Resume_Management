I also worked with the merchandising team to adjust forecasts for new launches and promotions. We defined min-max levels for each store and FOFO franchise and initiated timely transfers from the central warehouse to replenish stock.\nResult: As a result of these actions, we were able to improve our store fill rate by 20%, reduce stockouts by 10%, and decrease inventory holding costs by 15%."

I worked closely with stakeholders to understand their specific reporting needs and tailored the dashboard accordingly. I also automated the reporting process to ensure the information was always up-to-date and accurate.\nResult: The dashboard was well-received by stakeholders and became a key tool for monitoring inventory health and making data-driven decisions. It improved forecast accuracy by 12% and led to better inventory optimization across our channels."
