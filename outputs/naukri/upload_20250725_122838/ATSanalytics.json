    "Recommendations": [
        "The resume is well-structured and provides a comprehensive overview of Suvranshu Dash's qualifications, but it is **two pages long**.  Consider condensing information where possible to adhere to the preferred one-page format, especially for earlier roles or less relevant experiences, to improve readability and focus.",
        "While the resume includes a good list of both hard and soft skills, it could benefit from **quantifying these skills** with specific achievements. For example, instead of just listing 'Process Optimization & Automation', provide an example of how you improved a specific process and the resulting impact, such as 'Automated billing process, reducing manual workload by 30%'.",
        "The summary provides a good overview, but could be **more tailored to specific job descriptions**.  Customize the summary for each application to highlight the most relevant skills and experiences that match the job requirements, demonstrating a clear understanding of the role and how you can contribute.",
        "While projects are listed, elaborating on the **'Analyzed SAP Order to Cash (O2C) process'** and adding a brief description of the outcomes or improvements achieved would increase its impact. Quantify the 'business impact' detected for a stronger presentation.",
        "The resume is currently missing a **'Certifications' section**. Add any certifications, even if they seem minor, this will boost credibility by showcasing tangible proof of proficiency in specific areas.",
        "Even though you mention different tools in your work experience, adding them to the technical skills section will help you pass the ATS scan. The main reason for this is that the tool section will highlight all the tools at once.",
        "Optimize the resume for **ATS compatibility** by using keywords from the job description throughout the document and also use standard section headings and formatting to make it easier for the ATS to parse the information accurately."
