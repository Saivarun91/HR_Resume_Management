Consider condensing information where possible to adhere to the preferred one-page format, especially for earlier roles or less relevant experiences, to improve readability and focus.",
            "While the resume includes a good list of both hard and soft skills, it could benefit from **quantifying these skills** with specific achievements. For example, instead of just listing 'Process Optimization & Automation', provide an example of how you improved a specific process and the resulting impact, such as 'Automated billing process, reducing manual workload by 30%'.",
            "The summary provides a good overview, but could be **more tailored to specific job descriptions**.  Customize the summary for each application to highlight the most relevant skills and experiences that match the job requirements, demonstrating a clear understanding of the role and how you can contribute.",
            "While projects are listed, elaborating on the **'Analyzed SAP Order to Cash (O2C) process'** and adding a brief description of the outcomes or improvements achieved would increase its impact. Quantify the 'business impact' detected for a stronger presentation.",
            "The resume is currently missing a **'Certifications' section**. Add any certifications, even if they seem minor, this will boost credibility by showcasing tangible proof of proficiency in specific areas.",
