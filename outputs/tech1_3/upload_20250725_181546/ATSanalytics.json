        "The resume is 2 pages long which is acceptable, however, consider to short it into 1 page to improve the **format score**. Tailor the content to fit into a single page, highlighting the most relevant experiences and skills for the desired roles.",
        "While the resume showcases technical skills, it lacks explicit **soft skills**. Integrate soft skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving within the experience descriptions to demonstrate well-rounded capabilities.",
        "The resume is missing a **Certifications** section. Consider adding any relevant certifications to enhance credibility and demonstrate expertise in specific areas relevant to financial analysis, data analytics, or business consulting.",
        "While the education section is present, it could benefit from additional details. Consider mentioning relevant coursework, academic projects, or honors received during your PGDM or B.E. to showcase **academic achievements**.",
        "The contact details section is somewhat lacking in formatting. Ensure your **email address** and **LinkedIn profile URL** are clearly formatted and easily accessible. Consider adding a professional headshot to improve visual appeal and recognizability.",
        "While the skills section lists various technical skills, consider quantifying your proficiency levels. Use terms like 'Advanced,' 'Intermediate,' or 'Proficient' to provide a better understanding of your **skill levels** in tools like Excel, SQL, and Power BI.",
        "The objective statement is effective but could be further refined. Highlight your unique value proposition and tailor it to align specifically with the target roles in financial analysis, data analytics, or business consulting. Use **keywords** from the job descriptions."
